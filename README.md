# WebRTC client library

This repository contains the tooling to build the WebRTC libraries for the Nextcloud Talk Android and iOS apps.

Updates of WebRTC for the Talk clients will be done on a monthly basis.

The acutal stable version will be user:
- Android: https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/releases?platform=Android
- iOS: https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/releases?platform=iOS

Official WebRTC build guides:

- https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/+/main/docs/native-code/ios/index.md

## Build for Android 

To build WebRTC for Android follow those steps:

```
docker build -t webrtc .
mkdir webrtc
docker run -it --name webrtc-build -v "$(pwd)"/webrtc webrtc-build
# now in container
fetch --nohooks webrtc_android
gclient sync
cd src
# You'll ask for some interactions:
#  1. Skip snapcraft
#  2. Configure timezone
build/install-build-deps-android.sh
git checkout $TAG
gclient sync -D
tools_webrtc/android/build_aar.py
```

## Build for iOS

Requirements:

- XCode version 13.0 (exact version)

To build WebRTC for iOS follow those steps:

```
mkdir webrtc_ios
cd webrtc_ios
fetch --nohooks webrtc_ios
gclient sync
cd src
git checkout $TAG
gclient sync -D
cd tools_webrtc/ios
python build_ios_libs.py
```

If build succeeds, you will find the **WebRTC.xcframework** in `src/out_ios_libs/WebRTC.xcframework`

### Building on M1 Macs

Check if the command `python` is available. Most likley you need to link it (adjust the Xcode path accordingly):

```
sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
```

### Building multiple architectures

By default the following architectures are build:
```
'device:arm64', 'simulator:arm64', 'simulator:x64'
```

It is also possible to build for catalyst, the build command would look like this:

```
python build_ios_libs.py --arch "device:arm64" "simulator:arm64" "simulator:x64" "catalyst:arm64" "catalyst:x64"
```
